Fast Backend User Switch (TYPO3 Extension `beuser_fastswitch`)
==============================================================

> The `beuser_fastswitch` extension provides a very easy backend user
> switch for TYPO3 CMS administrator users.

## What does it do?

### With just two mouse clicks you can

* Switch to another backend user
* Edit another backend user (in a new tab)
* Show user info of a specific backend user (in a modal)

### It provides an AJAX based search

You can search users by **`realName`**, **`username`**, **`email`** or
**unique ID `uid`**.

### Ordering of listed users

The results are always ordered by `lastlogin DESC`. Since this speeds up
also the support if some editor is calling you that something isn't
working. You can then easily switch to the backend user without
searching for it.

### User list item features

* Trigger contextmenu of backend user record (by clicking on the avatar/icon)
* Edit backend user record (by clicking on the username or realName)
* Show element information popup (by clicking on the Info-Button)
* Switch to the backend user (by clicking on the Switch-Button)
